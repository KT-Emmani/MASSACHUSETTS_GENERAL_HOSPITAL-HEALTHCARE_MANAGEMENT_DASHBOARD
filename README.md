## Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing an end-to-end analytics solution for Massachusetts General Hospital to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, hospital encounters, procedures, readmissions, and financial performance. The goal was to transform raw hospital data into intuitive, executive-ready dashboards that support clinical, operational, and financial decision-making.

The solution consists of four interactive dashboards that offer both high-level summaries and detailed, patient-level views.
